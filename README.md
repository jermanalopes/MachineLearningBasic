## mt_cars --> Linear Regression and kNN
The mtcars dataset contains measurements on 11 different attributes for 32 different cars, where the headers are:
mpg - Miles per Gallon
cyl - # of cylinders
disp - displacement, in cubic inches
hp - horsepower
drat - driveshaft ratio (don't really KNOW cars, so if you've got questions - you know what to do. :-D
wt - weight
qsec - 1/4 mile time; a measure of acceleration
vs - 'V' or straight - engine shape
am - transmission; auto or manual
gear - # of gears
carb - # of carburetors.

Then, I used this dataset to train and test the Linear Regression algorithm. This is a basic test to learn more about this algorithm.



## Insurance.csv --> Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest
This data set consists of different information personal, where the final class is whether they have bought health insurance or not. This is a small sample CSV dataset for beginners to learn Classification Algorithms.Then, I used this dataset to train and test the Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms. This is a good choice to learn more about these machine learning techniques.
